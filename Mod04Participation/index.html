                <h2>Falling For An Autumn Display</h2>
                <p>I think that most people who have a foot planted solidly in two different cities or countries get asked regularly which they prefer. Since I started spending part of every year in France some 20 years ago, I frequently am asked to identify my preference: San Francisco or Sare? Bay Area or Basque Country?

                <p>Places you sink roots are a little like your kids, and you love each for their own special attributes. But I have to admit that, for me, the scales tip slightly toward the Basque Country. One big reason is the changing leaves that create an unforgettable autumn display, year after year.

                <h2>Seasons of Change</h2>
                <p>Maybe it comes from growing up in central Alaska, where winter hogs the year, taking up almost ten months with its cold, sunless presence, leaving spring, summer and fall to jostle for place in the remaining weeks. Maybe it’s just the poet in me. But I treasure the seasons of change, spring and fall.</p>
                <p>San Francisco is blessed with a mild, pleasant temperature, few scorchers, no freezes, little difference between the weather in July and January. The soft, mysterious fog seems to make up for the lack of seasons, but then back in Basque Country, I remember the special magic of spring and fall. For me, the changing leaves in their autumn display is the highlight of the year. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
